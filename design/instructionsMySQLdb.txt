install MAMP, MySQL-python 1.2.2, DJANGO 1.3, MySQL, XCode

How to install MySQL-python:

Attempt to import MySQLdb into python by typing:
python
import MySQLdb

if it fails, you have two options:

==OPTION 1:==

First Try: 
 #check python version
 python -V #make sure this says python-2.7 or 2.6
 which easy_install #this path should determine the python version easy_install works with

Then:
 sudo easy_install pip #pip is a much better installer for python packages than easy_install
 sudo pip install MySQL-python 
Attempt to import MySQLdb into python again
 
==OPTION 2:==

#if both programs should reference the same python version, and ideally python-2.7
MySQL-python

then:

sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib/libsqlclient.18.dylib /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib

####Note this did not immediately cause the import to work####
###did python import mysqlDB within the folder that contained libmysqlclient. maybe that was why it worked???###

This needs to be done no matter if the above was done or not, and only if you are using a MAMP database.

ADD 'HOST': '/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock', # For MAMP to know where to the socket is
to settings.py file in project root folder.
