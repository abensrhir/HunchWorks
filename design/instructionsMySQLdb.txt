This is for MAC OS X, commands will be similar in Windows and Linux, but
	may not be exactly as stated here.

You need Python version 2.4-2.7 as MySQL python does not currently work with
	python 3 at the moment.

install

setup tools (from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)
cd into the setup tools directory
to install type: sh setuptools then hit tab. It should look something like
	setuptools-0.6c9-py2.4.egg

Git (from http://git-scm.com/)
Run the DMG to install it. This is to pull and push to the github directory
You will need to setup your username and password in GIT as well as generate
	your key. http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/ should have everything you
	need to do

MySQL version 5.* As long as it is 5, there should be no problems.
	located at http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
Get the DMG, not the tar

XCode (this is located on your MAC install CD, under optional installs)

MAMP (this is for running a local MySQL/apache server on your localhost)
	download at http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html

DJANGO 1.3 from https://www.djangoproject.com/download/
	follow instrcutions on that webpage

MySQL-python 1.2.2 or 1.2.3 (I could not get 1.2.3 working on my MAC
	which is why I have 1.2.2 listed)

How to install MySQL-python:

==OPTION 1:==

First Try: 
 #check python version
 python -V #make sure this says python-2.7 or 2.6
 which easy_install #this path should determine the python version easy_install
 	works with

Then:
	sudo easy_install pip #pip is a much better installer for python packages 
		than easy_install
 	sudo pip install MySQL-python 
	Attempt to import MySQLdb into python again
 
==OPTION 2:==

#if both programs should reference the same python version, and ideally 
	python-2.7
Follow :
http://www.mangoorange.com/2008/08/01/installing-python-mysqldb-122-on-mac-os-x/

then if it fails still:

sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib/libsqlclient.18.dylib /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib

####Note this did not immediately cause the import to work####
###did python import mysqlDB within the folder that contained libmysqlclient.
maybe that was why it worked???###

If you are using MAMP this needed to be added to settings.py in the project folder

ADD 'HOST': '/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock', # For MAMP to know where
to the socket is to settings.py file in project root folder.
